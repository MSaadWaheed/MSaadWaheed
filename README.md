# Projects
StockWhispers:
I worked on a program with my team in a software engineering class. It included a sign-on page, a profile page, a page that displayed current stocks using an API, and a page where people can make posts. We used Python, Flask, and Bootstrap for the project.

# Goals
My goal is to expand my knowledge in Software Engineering and learn more in-depth about the languages I know and how I can use them in the future.
